An example of a bowling calculator https://www.bowlinggenius.com/

Things we would like to see you master
----------------------
- State manager (frontend)
- clean code
- testable code with ie. unit-tests
- good naming of functions and variables
- Well designed (short and precise) functions
- Well designed classes

What should be done?
----------------------
- A calculator service that consist of the bowling logic (Backend. If doing frontend only make this service in frontend only) This service can can have a function like `function calculate(currentRoll: Roll, historicRolls: array of Rolls)`
- A view to fill in all the bowling values (Frontend)
- Atleast one stateless component (Frontend)
- Proper interfaces and types (Frontend and Backend)

Examples of unit test
----------------------
 - strike, spare, 4|0 should give the output 38
 - perfect serie (12 strikes) should give 300
   
How to write it?
----------------------
- You are free to use any frontend framework (Vue, Angular or react) for frontend
- You can use any backend (Node, PHP, C#, Java, Python, etc)
- You don't need any database

Time

You have 72 hours after the test have been sent to you.

Any question and finished result can be sent to andreas.helgegren@getaccept.com
